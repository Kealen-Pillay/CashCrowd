Vodafone,Wade Kimpton,1,"If I could give them zero stars I would. Literally the most uncaring, inept business in NZ. They have Literally stole money from me. I took out phone insure on a phone I brought from the US, vodafone was aware of this and still sold me Phone Insure, when it came time to collect told me it wasn't their problem it was Chubbs issue, Chubb said Vodafone shouldn't have accepted payment.Outcome, over a year of paying for insurance i can't use and won't be refunded.Imagine if I didn't pay my bill. Disgusting behavior from a NZ company."
Vodafone,Private,1,I can‚Äôt be bothered going into detail but this company is a red flag I‚Äôve been fighting for money they owe now for 3 months they just like to mess with your head PLEASE anyone thinking of joining think twice read reviews I give them a big fat 0
Vodafone,Munckinontour,1,"I wish these reviews were better communicated online. Vodafone really is the worst in every aspect of customer service. Impossible to speak to anyone, impossible to get issues resolved. I could go on about my frustrations in detail. You will waste a huge amount of your valuable time being with Vodafone. Put simply NEVER USE VODAFONE."
Vodafone,Jim Waite,1,"My wife and I arrived in NZ during covid pandemic. We arrived at the MIQ hotel in Auckland city. We didn't have a NZ sim card so were given a Vodafone sim.We attempted to activate it by phone and it didn't work. We phoned the 777 number but were kept waiting for 30 minutes before we hung up.We won't activate it and will only use to receive sms. We will go with another more reliable company.Vodafone, you didn't lose two customers, you lost two prospective customers."
Vodafone,August Du,1,"Don't recommend this business for several reasons. 1) their packages are pricy. For the same broadband Fiber 100, they sell $80 while some other companies sell Fibre 300 at $79 with 4 months free. They won't show you the package on your invoice so you won't know it. 2) They charge you a late payment fee ($16+GST)while at the same time they stop your internet until they receive your payment. 3)the customer service is inconsistent as they outsource that to some other countries. Always took long time to sort out the issues. 4) The App really sucks and confusing. 5) No way/Hard to check your own account online. Needs a lot of information but has no idea of where to find them. Very confusing. Never seen a business doing service like this."
Vodafone,Charly Smith,1,"Wish I never moved to Vodafone, internet is so slow I can‚Äôt even watch videos or take a video call with on my data. Might as well not have any data at all how slow it is"
Vodafone,Gill,5,"Wednesday went into Vodafone Rotorua I was apprehensive as the Tauranga Crossing store staff are rude , patronising and completely disinterested in helping even though I have been with Vodafone for years . The difference in the Rotorua store was incredible I ended up being helped by three different young men who went above and beyond. I also noticed they treated other customers with the same delightful manner .Thank you Rotorua vodafone you should go to Tauranga and teach them some customer skillsüëç"
Vodafone,Sonya D,1,"Pathetic service! You would just go in circles with your problems.I signed up recently for my broadband, then they haven't sent me the bill through (yes, they had my mobile number and yet I was not contacted) plus they must have the wrong email entered.Called back, was told 3 different things by 3 different people, no result.I paid in full even whatever was not due, they said you have to wait for 24 hrs. However, a person earlier said, he will do it straight away!Lot's of people said, don't chose Vodafone yet I did! Should have listened! Worst service ever"
Vodafone,Candycane,1,Very trash coulden't even watch the Superbowl because the wifi kept disconnecting and I can't even connect to the 2nd network they gave us this service sucks!
Vodafone,David Leegwater,1,"Another fake Shalini duvvuruFake person leaving a fake review, Vodafone is trash"
Vodafone,Patricia,1,"After months of problems with Vodafone TV, and several on-line and phone discussions, it stopped working altogether.  A helpful call centre person said he'd send me a new box if I signed up for 12 months.  Declined to do that and insisted I be issued with a device that provides the service I'm paying for.  New box received the next day and was told I would get a credit on my next bill for loss of service.  Instead on my next bill I got a charge of $27.93 for other calls and services"" on my home phone: Quantity 12"
Vodafone,Shahzad Syed,1,Terrible network coverage and absolutely atrocious customer service with guaranteed hidden charges. For all researching please please do yourself a favor and literally chose ANY other provider.I sincerely did not want to give then 1 star but you can't write a review without clicking a star. I have lived in nz for 15 years and have yet to meet a happy Vodafone customer.  This is in addition to my own experiences listed above. Usually I forget about these things but gosh they deserve this review  Make your life simple...chose 2 degrees

Vodafone,Rob King,1,"Crap, poor online service, unable to complete transactions.... Still."
Vodafone,Sophie r,1,Westfield Newmarket staff very rude and unhelpful.Sat waiting for customer service for 40 minutes while staff did not say one word to me. Would have been okay to wait but no one even came upto me and said we‚Äôll be with you in a minute. Extremely rude and unhelpful. Will be changing providers immediately and not purchasing another item
Vodafone,Abby Walker,1,"Celebrating as finally, after 3 years I have managed to get a simple account closure/transfer and refund back for mistaken billing sorted out and returned to me. At least I assume now that I have been able to submit a refund request it will actually be sent. Although I thought when I asked them to close my account 3 years ago, they'd do that too."
Vodafone,Peter,1,"We shut down our accounts with Vodafone about one year ago and ever since we have been getting charged an administration fee"" on a emailed CREDIT BALANCE. This has cost us approximately $25.00! Repeated contacts have failed to rectify the situation."""
Vodafone,Alex,1,Customer service was appalling. 2 of the staff I spoke to (with Indian accents) were rude. Please get your personnel trained regarding standard customer service.
Vodafone,sam pal,1,The wise internet provider beware. I have been with Vodafone for 28 years. They are money grabber with no service provider.  Dont get confused with fancy ads. The government is also a pussy and corporate puppet. Vodafone have no real technicians or people that know what they do. An outsourced brand with monopoly with chorus. They use another service for other service and other service making you confused. All of them are a way of part of legal corruption and confusion of customers. They have no other mission rather than pocketing money. I had internet interpretation every minute during Covit 19. The excuse was Covit 19 for Vodafone.  Non of thier staff work on the field so why they are part of Covit 19 shut down or reduced service?  Are they health workers? No. So shame on you Vodafone
Vodafone,Francesca,1,"Zero costumer support. After one year of constant chasing to solve a simple problem now it has been 4 months that I cannot manage to cancel my account! They don't pick up the phone and when they do they keep you at the phone for an hour, often the communication gets cut and still do not solve the problem. I still receive bills even though I moved to another company and I have contact them 3 times to beg them to close my account! These guys are still asking for money and I feel so powerless because there is literally no one that can help, no costumer support. Please do not join Vodafone, ever."
Vodafone,Vaclav Novak,1,I just had another shocking experience with Vodafone customer service and billing department it is nearly impossible to explain how many times and how much trouble they caused to me in the past. I'm still with them because I always manage to get best deal at the end of long frustrating calls. I feel like I'm done with them now and will look for another provider when my term will be over. Hopefully there will be massive improvement before it happen.
Vodafone,Ryan Ridderhof,1,"Great network absolutely horrific customer service, the call center is filled with friendly people who cant help you with anything, changing you address is a 3 week process that is so stressful that it makes being excited about moving into a new house impossible. Going into a store is no more helpful so don't bother with that.This company is set up to get new customers they are not interested in you after that. Don't be fooled by all the fancy deals you can get, its not worth the headache."
Vodafone,D Plum,1,"Terrible. The customer service is truly awful. I have applied for some changes to my Vodafone account/plans etc. There are no confirmation emails.Its very hard to get through. Kept on hold. Redirected. Very hard to understand the person trying to help me ( we have different accents). Never given a time for the new services I applied for, just told it would occur within 3-7 or 3-5 working days. Rang again as there were no changes. Told wait two more days. Nope. Lol.Vodafone‚Äôs been so frustrating. I feel Im just being fobbed off and get a feeling too that Im just being a nuisance. They use to be great. Now they have lost my support. The online chat is a joke.I won‚Äôt phone again as it‚Äôs an ordeal."
Vodafone,wcwano,1,"If i could give zero stars, i most definitely would. The most useless internet provider in New Zealand. If you feel like talking to some indian on the otherside of the world who does not have a clue and you like to sit on hold for hours on end without getting anywhere then this internet provider is the one for you"
Vodafone,Todd,4,I have been with Vodafone over 20 years.Just upgraded to HFC  Fibre X with them and all went very well.Downer Tech is a Kiwi and very caring at making sure all worked well before leaving the house after 2 hours . have 800 download and at least 100 upload most days.Managed to get a  deal for 1 year and transferring to  a Sky TV box ( from  Telstra Saturn box) rather than Vodafone Box as have heard too many issues with Vodafone Box.I did have one issue re the form going to Sky to change over as details were filled in wrong ..it was only after I spoke to NZ sounding voice person that it was corrected ( after 5 phone calls) I read most people are not happy so was a little worried at upgrading to Fibre X but being honest we are pretty happy with result.
Vodafone,Sarah Caverly,1,Been a customer with them for almost 6 months now. I call them weekly stating how my internet isnt working. Always 45mins-hour on hold. Internet is good for maybe max 2 days before it stops working and I have to call them again. You guys should really be paying my phone bill too for how many hours a week I spend on the phone with you guys.
Vodafone,Karl,1,"All well and good until literally anything goes wrong. Good luck getting even the smallest issue resolved they have literally the worst customer service I've ever experienced. My Sky box broke and Ive been calling them for over 2 months asking for a replacement to be sent out, spent countless hours on hold, every call takes at least 3 transfers and all information is lost between transfers so you have to start from scratch. Ive been told totally different stories by people on the same call and been lied to multiple times. If you stay on the line long enough sometimes you get a Kiwi and think you've hit the jackpot, they seem really friendly and helpful and refreshingly professional after the total incompetence of the off-shore call center but they won't actually do anything to solve your problem either. What a waste of time. Will be cancelling all of my services and moving to someone less awful. Avoid Vodafone at all costs, it's not worth it."
Vodafone,GG,1,"I was called and offered a cheaper monthly bill because I had been a loyal customer for several years. Was offered Vodafone TV, I said I didn't want it and I wasn't interested in it. The man on the phone said all good (in a roundabout way) and said my bill would go from $110ish to about $89 - from the top of my head. He said he would email me the contract. I never received a contract and didn't get a bill for nearly two months regardless of me emailing and asking for one. I still made my weekly payments so my credit was good. I receive a Vodafone TV in the mail...I finally get a bill emailed with a new account number and I am told I owe them $165...after half an hour waiting to speak to someone he explains I have not been paying my new account and while he transfers the money to my new account I am informed I should just pay the whole lot anyway, just to be safe. He then goes to tell me that after my 12 months runs out my bill will include an addtional $29.95 for the Vodafone TV box that I was sent and did not want, something the previous Vodafone Representitive never told me about, nor sent me the contract.He transferred me to another line to sort out the TV box problem and I am told the lines are too busy, ring back later and then I get hung up on.I send emails and get bullsh*t responses like provide us with the 'siebel account number, TPII simplex account number and legacy account number' - after I they have all my information. It's been months of frustration and I am switching provider.I will NEVER use Vodafone again and recommend everyone else to look elsewhere."
Vodafone,Peter Scharmach,1,"Just Bad, you stay in the line for ages, every time requesting youraccount no. there must be really problems in the management,or obviously making money to easy, so they are not keen to maintain their customers, they knowledge and service is by far unacceptable, just wondering why it is working fine with Vodafonein Europe? but here it was a big mistake to change to that provider.I can not recommend any person to shift the broadband serviceto Vodafone, its just a nightmare.if I need to write it in particular, it would take days....."
Vodafone,wang,1,"stay away, they TOOK YOUR MONEY without even telling you or getting your consent.I have $27 credit on my mobile account on the statement from Vodafone on Feb 2018, and next statement I received show only $2 credit left while I didn't use the sim card at all. contacted Vodafone, they said they started charging admin fee without even letting me know, and refused to refund me the money, this is rubbery!"
