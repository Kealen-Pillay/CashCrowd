I took out phone insure on a phone I brought from the US, vodafone was aware of this and still sold me Phone Insure, when it came time to collect told me it wasn't their problem it was Chubbs issue, Chubb said Vodafone shouldn't have accepted payment.Outcome, over a year of paying for insurance i can't use and won't be refunded.Imagine if I didn't pay my bill.

For the same broadband Fiber 100, they sell $80 while some other companies sell Fibre 300 at $79 with 4 months free. They won't show you the package on your invoice so you won't know it. 2) They charge you a late payment fee ($16+GST)while at the same time they stop your internet until they receive your payment. 3)the customer service is inconsistent as they outsource that to some other countries. Always took long time to sort out the issues. 4) The App really sucks and confusing. 5) No way/Hard to check your own account online. Needs a lot of information but has no idea of where to find them. Very confusing. Never seen a business doing service like this."

I receive a Vodafone TV in the mail...I finally get a bill emailed with a new account number and I am told I owe them $165...after half an hour waiting to speak to someone he explains I have not been paying my new account and while he transfers the money to my new account I am informed I should just pay the whole lot anyway, just to be safe. He then goes to tell me that after my 12 months runs out my bill will include an addtional $29.95 for the Vodafone TV box that I was sent and did not want, something the previous Vodafone Representitive never told me about, nor sent me the contract.He transferred me to another line to sort out the TV box problem and I am told the lines are too busy, ring back later and then I get hung up on.I send emails and get bullsh*t responses like provide us with the 'siebel account number, TPII simplex account number and legacy account number' - after I they have all my information.

I went through the steps and for some reason it wasn't working, I looked at their trouble shooting tips and they also didn't work.  I sat on the 0800 number for more than an hour 3 different occasions and couldn't waste any more time of my day waiting to have my call answered. I found an email address, which wasn't easily found, sent them an email, had no response via email, had a phone call from someone while I was at work so obviously couldn't receive their help, I asked for the manager as I wasn't happy with their service and was contemplating continuing the contract given how disappointing the first two weeks had been. (During this time I was sent two bill invoices)  A few days later sent another email as no follow up call had happened, 4 days later I got a response which went to my spam folder.  I heard nothing and received a postage bag to send the modem back so I assumed my wishes in the email were being met. A couple weeks later get a cancellation fee withdrawn from my account Of $230 (not a small sum). Once I noticed the withdrawal I went in store and complained, they pretty much blamed me for not responding to their one call while I was at work and said because they had made efforts that weren't met back by me the cancelation fee still stands. I signed up to Vodafone broadband and was connected to the internet that day, I had trouble connecting the modem, called their help line and was answered within 5 minutes with a helpful person on the other end. The service in comparison is greatly different and two degrees service is unacceptable. No efforts were made to come to an agreement or resolution of the problem. Suggestions: have someone assigned to an account problem so it actually seems like you care that your customers need help if they're not connected. Have a callback option on your support line. make your email address easier to find on your web sight. Have an email address that doesn't go to the spam folder, my bill emails don't go to that inbox so why would the real person emails go there. Fix your reception, I'm in the middle of Hamilton city and get one to two bars at my house! I had better service living 45 minutes out of town in the country side."

        "message": "Legitimately the worst telco in New Zealand, which is sad because they used to be great. What happened 2Degrees?I made an online order for a phone and account plan, waited a week without hearing anything about it. So I called in and was told it would ship any day. I called again three days later and was told the account had been flagged for fraud and I needed to contact the fraud team. Why didn't the fraud team contact ME? Aren't I the customer? The one trying to spend money with your company? Rediculous.So I asked for an email, the lady said she'd text it to me. She didn't.So I called again the same day, get a different service rep, and THIS one tells me that my order was outright CANCELLED by the fraud team the DAY AFTER MY INITIAL ORDER. Why didn't person one or person two tell me this?So I go into a retail store thinking I can just get it sorted in person, account is flagged again, and cancelled by the fraud team. Though this time they were kind enough to let me know. Just that it had been cancelled by the way - no reasons as to why.So I went to Spark and got a phone & plan same day without any issue. We have great credit - well we did. After having to get multiple credit checks done by 2D and then Spark - it's likely that my score has tanked.It gets better though, this entire saga happened two months ago and 2Degrees continues to send me emails saying I owe them $80 for an account that was cancelled next day and for a device I never received. This is despite their CS team assuring me in writing via email that there is no amount owing on my account. The level of ineptitude at 2Degrees is mind boggling - stay away."

Obtained a sim card ($49) from Spark in Auckland. Unable to check that it worked as I hadn't had time to charge the device since landing 24 hours earlier. Later the installed sim produced a device message of 'unknown provider' and refused to connect to the internet. Took it back to the Spark shop where (a different) salesperson  looked totally bewildered and said the problem was probably the device 'operating on different frequencies than are used here'. Wouldn't refund the price of the sim as it was pre-paid. Found the manager who then checked the compatibility of their sim cards with the M7350-they weren't. She still refused to refund the sim card price. Went across the street to Vodaphone and obtained a sim card ($40) that does work. So summary of Spark: sales staff who know feck all and managers who don't give a toss; probably explains the overall Trustpilot rating. For any New Zealanders reading this - be thankful you have a decent rugby team because if Spark is an example of Kiwi expertise, technology & customer service you are in big trouble!"
