We changed providors as our monthly bill became huge  the company  does  not give any notice or warnings, they simply rip consumers off. Especially if you are elderly and not technically inclined. Frankly the indudtry should be regulated to prevent this kind of greedy behaviour.

In the past, they have been able to offer discounted rates to existing customers when there were promotions for new customers. Unfortunately, this was not the case any more in the last couple of years and their contact centre or sales department stuffed up with a change I already said no to. This created unnecessary hussle for me. Besides, I feel the price is quite high compared with some other good providers.     "
