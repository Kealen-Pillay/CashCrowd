Spark New Zealand Reviews | Read Customer Service Reviews of spark.co.nz,Ashley,https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg,"Terrible, I brought my husband and I samsung watches. On our shared account, I went in on my own and got them on our plan. My watch overheated and froze within 2 weeks, it only works for 3 hours at a time  it took 4 months for them to return from the technician and still has same problem. Now I want to cancel the plans but I can't unless my husband does it for me. I can't understand I feel so ripped off. Also his watch won't connect withought his phone on him which is what the plan is supposed to be for so we can usd them withought our phones for sport ect. Useless."

Then after talking for 30 minutes we were told they would email there service people to see if they could fix the problem.  Two days later we got and email to say the problem was fixed. Call was answered from overseas the service team is in NZ. So emailing is the only way they contact each other.

Just ruined the start of the FPL season.  Generally the f1 content is now ok (if it will play) but then that provided by Sky who know how to do this.  Please, please hand your rights to a company who can make use of them to give a customer service."

I'm trying to find out about Data Roaming for when travelling overseas. It's chatbot said it didn't understand my question and would I like to go through to a real person. I said yes but it just cycled around the same question. So I tried logging into the app but it wouldn't accept my password"

Spark New Zealand Reviews | Read Customer Service Reviews of spark.co.nz | 7 of 19,Charli zhang,https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg,Some of their stuff are unprofessional. They try to EDUCATE you instead of helping you. They don’t care about the customer satisfaction at all. They only say what they wanna say and blame you

Don’t sign up with them! Customer service is a 0. They took $20 out of my account for no reason. If your going to choose any phone provider, don’t choose this one."

Spark New Zealand Reviews | Read Customer Service Reviews of spark.co.nz | 12 of 19,Shawn Minnie,https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg,Pathetic service. I believe that they have charged me more than the broadband usage i used and they refuse to supply me with the info on my usage. Absolutely useless. Stay way.

Usually they don’t  even tell you you’re low on data until they’ve already charged you. Hope this has been fixed for newer customers but I’ll never go back on a prepay plan unless I’m forced."
Spark New Zealand Reviews | Read Customer Service Reviews of spark.co.nz | 14 of 19,George Thony,https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg,"We got a chorus technician out via spark in November last year to re connect our copper cable in our office.  Not only did he fail to connect it. He left it hanging out of the telephone jack for the world to see. When we called spark asking them to send someone to fox it, they just ran us in circles and this continued for the past 10 months up till last week, where instead of fixing the wire in our office they disconnected the copper wire connection entirely. Now instead of paying $90 for internet in the wrong part of the house we are paying for no internet at all and are still being run in circles trying to fix it. If there was another service provider in our area we would change in a heartbeat."

Spark New Zealand Reviews | Read Customer Service Reviews of spark.co.nz | 16 of 19,TS-UK,https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg,"Arrived from the UK with TP-Link M7350 mobile WiFi device which I have used successfully with local sim cards in Ireland, Finland and the Czech Republic. Obtained a sim card ($49) from Spark in Auckland. Unable to check that it worked as I hadn't had time to charge the device since landing 24 hours earlier. Later the installed sim produced a device message of 'unknown provider' and refused to connect to the internet. Took it back to the Spark shop where (a different) salesperson  looked totally bewildered and said the problem was probably the device 'operating on different frequencies than are used here'. Wouldn't refund the price of the sim as it was pre-paid. Found the manager who then checked the compatibility of their sim cards with the M7350-they weren't. She still refused to refund the sim card price. Went across the street to Vodaphone and obtained a sim card ($40) that does work. So summary of Spark: sales staff who know feck all and managers who don't give a toss; probably explains the overall Trustpilot rating. For any New Zealanders reading this - be thankful you have a decent rugby team because if Spark is an example of Kiwi expertise, technology & customer service you are in big trouble!"

Coz spark will send you another bill at the end of the month with out telling you what it is for. Appalling customer service too! So disappointed dealing with this people. You have to go all the way to their shop to know what was your bill about! Ridiculous!"
