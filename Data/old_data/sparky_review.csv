On our shared account, I went in on my own and got them on our plan. My watch overheated and froze within 2 weeks, it only works for 3 hours at a time  it took 4 months for them to return from the technician and still has same problem. Now I want to cancel the plans but I can't unless my husband does it for me. I can't understand I feel so ripped off. Also his watch won't connect withought his phone on him which is what the plan is supposed to be for so we can usd them withought our phones for sport ect. Useless.",Date of experience: 23 January 2023,,,,,,,,,

Then after talking for 30 minutes we were told they would email there service people to see if they could fix the problem.  Two days later we got and email to say the problem was fixed. Call was answered from overseas the service team is in NZ. So emailing is the only way they contact each other.,Date of experience: 04 June 2023,,,,,,,,,

I'm trying to find out about Data Roaming for when travelling overseas. It's chatbot said it didn't understand my question and would I like to go through to a real person. I said yes but it just cycled around the same question. So I tried logging into the app but it wouldn't accept my password"," so I reset the password but it still wouldn't open. Tried it again and it didn't send the link. Tried it a 3rd time and almost got in but it said it's sent a verification code to my phone. But it hadn't. So I clicked on the link called ""Didn't receive code"" and up popped a message saying that it had sent the code. But it hadn't. So I clicked on the link called ""Didn't receive code"" and a message came up saying it had sent the code. I checked and it hadn't. Repeated this processes ad infinitum.""",Date of experience: 09 March 2023,,,,,,,,

Usually they don’t  even tell you you’re low on data until they’ve already charged you.

Not only did he fail to connect it. He left it hanging out of the telephone jack for the world to see. When we called spark asking them to send someone to fox it, they just ran us in circles and this continued for the past 10 months up till last week, where instead of fixing the wire in our office they disconnected the copper wire connection entirely. Now instead of paying $90 for internet in the wrong part of the house we are paying for no internet at all and are still being run in circles trying to fix it. If there was another service provider in our area we would change in a heartbeat.",Date of experience: 23 September 2020,,,,,,,,,

Obtained a sim card ($49) from Spark in Auckland. Unable to check that it worked as I hadn't had time to charge the device since landing 24 hours earlier. Later the installed sim produced a device message of 'unknown provider' and refused to connect to the internet. Took it back to the Spark shop where (a different) salesperson  looked totally bewildered and said the problem was probably the device 'operating on different frequencies than are used here'. Wouldn't refund the price of the sim as it was pre-paid. Found the manager who then checked the compatibility of their sim cards with the M7350-they weren't. She still refused to refund the sim card price. Went across the street to Vodaphone and obtained a sim card ($40) that does work. So summary of Spark: sales staff who know feck all and managers who don't give a toss; probably explains the overall Trustpilot rating. For any New Zealanders reading this - be thankful you have a decent rugby team because if Spark is an example of Kiwi expertise, technology & customer service you are in big trouble!",Date of experience: 15 January 2020,,,,,,,,,
