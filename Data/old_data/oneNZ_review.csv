Literally the most uncaring, inept business in NZ. They have Literally stole money from me. I took out phone insure on a phone I brought from the US, vodafone was aware of this and still sold me Phone Insure, when it came time to collect told me it wasn't their problem it was Chubbs issue, Chubb said Vodafone shouldn't have accepted payment.Outcome, over a year of paying for insurance i can't use and won't be refunded.Imagine if I didn't pay my bill. Disgusting behavior from a NZ company.",Date of experience: 07 August 2023,

For the same broadband Fiber 100, they sell $80 while some other companies sell Fibre 300 at $79 with 4 months free. They won't show you the package on your invoice so you won't know it. 2) They charge you a late payment fee ($16+GST)while at the same time they stop your internet until they receive your payment. 3)the customer service is inconsistent as they outsource that to some other countries. Always took long time to sort out the issues. 4) The App really sucks and confusing. 5) No way/Hard to check your own account online. Needs a lot of information but has no idea of where to find them. Very confusing. Never seen a business doing service like this.",Date of experience: 11 April 2022,

I have been with Vodafone for 28 years. They are money grabber with no service provider.  Dont get confused with fancy ads. The government is also a pussy and corporate puppet. Vodafone have no real technicians or people that know what they do. An outsourced brand with monopoly with chorus. They use another service for other service and other service making you confused. All of them are a way of part of legal corruption and confusion of customers. They have no other mission rather than pocketing money. I had internet interpretation every minute during Covit 19. The excuse was Covit 19 for Vodafone.  Non of thier staff work on the field so why they are part of Covit 19 shut down or reduced service?  Are they health workers? No. So shame on you Vodafone,Date of experience: 02 April 2020,

Ive been told totally different stories by people on the same call and been lied to multiple times. If you stay on the line long enough sometimes you get a Kiwi and think you've hit the jackpot, they seem really friendly and helpful and refreshingly professional after the total incompetence of the off-shore call center but they won't actually do anything to solve your problem either.

I never received a contract and didn't get a bill for nearly two months regardless of me emailing and asking for one. I still made my weekly payments so my credit was good. I receive a Vodafone TV in the mail...I finally get a bill emailed with a new account number and I am told I owe them $165...after half an hour waiting to speak to someone he explains I have not been paying my new account and while he transfers the money to my new account I am informed I should just pay the whole lot anyway, just to be safe. He then goes to tell me that after my 12 months runs out my bill will include an addtional $29.95 for the Vodafone TV box that I was sent and did not want, something the previous Vodafone Representitive never told me about, nor sent me the contract.He transferred me to another line to sort out the TV box problem and I am told the lines are too busy, ring back later and then I get hung up on.I send emails and get bullsh*t responses like provide us with the 'siebel account number, TPII simplex account number and legacy account number' - after I they have all my information.
